# Linked List

This project contains a skeleton for you to implement a linked list. This is a
test-driven project. Run the tests and read the top-most error. If it's not
clear what is failing, open the **test/test.js** file to figure out what the
test is expecting. Make the top-most test pass.

Keep making the top-most test pass until all tests pass.

## Instructions

* Clone the project from
  https://github.com/appacademy-starters/data-structures-linked-list-starter.
* `cd` into the project folder
* `npm install` to install dependencies in the project root directory
* `npm test` to run the specs
* You can view the test cases in `/test/test.js`. Your job is to write code in
  the `/lib/linked_list.js` that implements the `Node` and `LinkedList` classes
  to make the tests pass.
